                <h1>Welcome to The Community Seafood Initiative!</h1>
                
                <p>We provide access to relevant information, applied research, and innovative 
                    economic opportunities through a unique partnership with Oregon State 
                    University's Coastal Oregon Marine Experiment Station, the Seafood Lab and 
                    Food Innovation Center as well as Enterprise Cascadia.   Recent projects

                <p>As the owner of Fish Trax&trade; The Community Seafood Initiative has pioneered 
                    the design and implementation of a powerful electronic fishery information

                    to key markets and audiences.</p>
                    
                <p>We have partnered with leading universities around the country on a unique 
                    program called Seafood Health Facts - dedicated to demystifying seafood in 
                    a world of confusing and contradictory claims and counterclaims.  Seafood 
                    Health Facts is designed to educate health care professionals and consumers 
                    alike on balancing the benefits and risks of seafood consumption.</p>

                    governed by a 9-member board of directors and is headquartered in Newport, Oregon.</p>
