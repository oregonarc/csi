                <p>We provide access to relevant information, applied research, and innovative

                    program called Seafood Health Facts - dedicated to demystifying seafood in 
                    a world of confusing and contradictory claims and counterclaims.  Seafood 
                    Health Facts is designed to educate health care professionals and consumers 
                    alike on balancing the benefits and risks of seafood consumption.</p>
